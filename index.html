			<p><a href="http://harvardxdesign.org" target="_blank">HarvardxDesign</a> is an annual conference launched in 2012 organized by student organizations at Harvard Graduate School of Design and Harvard Business School. We bring together creative thinkers, design luminaries, professors, industry leaders, and students to engage, debate, and reinterpret design across scales and sectors.</p>

			<p>Designers have always used their hands to craft and imagine new worlds. While the instabilities and inequities in our society have been exposed over this past year, design can be used to build, leverage, and confront power structures at various scales. This year's theme explores Power by Design as represented by hands and the many forms they take, from vessels of control to symbols of solidarity, to provoke discussions about the power held by designers as agents of change.

		<h1>Confronting Reality</h1>

		<p>Some truths can only be learned through abstraction. How do designers help us confront truths about our world – past, present, and future? What can we learn about our own realities by traveling, whether geographically, historically, or dimensionally? In this panel, we will engage with artists, mappers, curators, film directors, and tourism operators to explore how a new perspective can help us confront truths about the realities we inhabit.</p>

		<h1>Escaping Reality</h1>

		<p>If 2020 has taught us anything, it’s the importance of escaping. We escaped for the sake of fun, for our mental health, and for a dose of artistic inspiration. How do designers invent new worlds? How much escapism is healthy, and when does escapism become denial? How can escaping reality help us to confront the world around us more responsibly? We’ll learn from creatives who use set design, VR filmmaking, installations, and even rollercoasters, to learn about the pleasure, and necessity, of escaping reality.</p>

		<h1>Constructing Reality</h1>

		<p>How do designers shape not only our present, but also our future? How much can they shape reality, and when do they simply have to confront the realities around us? Is technology an enabler, or a limiting force, for constructing our reality? What can we learn from a machine that we can’t learn from ourselves? We will explore all these questions and more with a panel of architects, AI artists, and designers whose canvas is the present, and the future.</p>

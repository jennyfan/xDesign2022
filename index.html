			<p><a href="https://harvardx.design/" target="_blank">HarvardxDesign</a> is an annual conference launched in 2012 organized by student organizations at Harvard Graduate School of Design and Harvard Business School. We bring together creative thinkers, design luminaries, professors, industry leaders, and students to engage, debate, and reinterpret design across scales and sectors.</p>

			<p>Designers have always used their hands to craft and imagine new worlds. While the instabilities and inequities in our society have been exposed over this past year, design can be used to build, leverage, and confront power structures at various scales. This year's theme explores Power by Design as represented by hands and the many forms they take, from vessels of control to symbols of solidarity, to provoke discussions about the power held by designers as agents of change.
